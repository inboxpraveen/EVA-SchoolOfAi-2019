# Assignment 14: High's & Low's

### 1. Major references

[How to train your ResNet](https://myrtle.ai/how-to-train-your-resnet/) : A great source to analyze and understand how, why & what contributes to every evidence learned by a deep learning model. It helped me to gain more insights as well as deeper understanding of so many concepts related to time, batch normalization & convolutions as a whole.

[DAWN Benchmar on Cifar10](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/benchmark/CIFAR10/train.html) : Some of the most inspiring & motivational results out here are just beyond imagination. Even though large number of submissions are on pytorch, the techniques used always indulge me to why or how a particular strategy works or doesn't.



### 2. The Architecture: DavidNet [or] Small ResNet [or] ResNet9
